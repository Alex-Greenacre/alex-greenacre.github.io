# Alex Greenacre Website Portfolio #

## Introduction ##
Website portfolio for my personal projects and updates on coding related personal work. 

current link to site is https://alex-greenacre.github.io/

## Webstack And Deployment ##
The website is made up of static pages generated by jekyll allowing for templating and blog pages to be used whilst still maintaining compatibility with github pages in which the branch is deployed to.    

This deployment on github pages means that all content pushed to the /main branch is compiled and displayed on this site.  

## Running Locally ##
To run locally ruby with gem and bundler is required after which the following code is required to run:<br> 
<code>bundle install</code> 
is required to download all dependencies <br>
<code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code>
runs the server on 127.0.0.1:4000
