Since first typing Hello World in 2013 I have been hooked on all things programming, joining my first job in 2016, I have built a career in software testing for over 6 years working on large scale projects such as that for the NHS, whilst also progressing academically gaining top grades in both Bachelors and Masters levels. 

Through this time I have built a strong work ethic valuing team work and ~~coffee~~ communication as essential to the work place. My main goal is to ensure that I'm proud of my work. That I've tried my best and put everything that I can into it, I would much rather give it my all and fail than produce sub par work.    
## Outside of work 
Avid coffee and music lover all round, I spend the rest of my time outside of work playing too many video games, badly cooking, catching up with friends and looking for my next holiday.   
## Specialisations  
My main specialisation is in software testing having a strong knowledge of the area I can test any website or api, although my main strengths lie in accessibility and automated testing.
Outside of this I have a strong interest in data analysis and science working on reports and AI models with some of my best work within my academic learning being from these subjects.
