Because I'm trying to keep the website as clean and easy to use as possible there isn't going to be alot of colour, this isn't great as it can come across as a bit dull. To combat this I decided to create a divider between the header/footer and the main body, the aim of this was to provide colour to the page whilst also not effecting its readability.  

## Design Process ##

The orignal design was inspired by the early tech logos and designs (apple logo, racing lines on the nes, etc) this was suposed to give a retro styled look to the page bringing in a variety of colours, unfortunatly I couldn't really find a colour scheme that would fit well with the dark colour scheme of the header and the light body. To address this a new design was chosen this used a gradient colour scheme to transition from the darker header to the lighter body.

To apply the new design I used a blue colour scheme going from midnight blue in the header to a light blue before the body, I think this change makes the website so much more uniform whilst still keeping colour, using blue means I can incorporate blue and purple of links and visted links into the colour scheme without having to change well established colour standards for the links (such as a green link text if green was used),Overall I do like the new design I might still make some changes or revisit it in the future mabey adding or removing more colours or revisitng the colour scheme if required.
