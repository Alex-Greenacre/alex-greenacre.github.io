Hello and welcome to my blog! 

The purpose of this is to share my projects,reports and ideas that I am working on personally 
Hopefully this site should document every project I want to do and serve as a showcase for all the personal work that I have achieved

This website is long overdue and I'm extremely excited to getting this up and working 

I'll be sending out blogs on my upcoming projects soon as well as well as archiving a few projects that I worked on in the past 

Hope whoever reads this will find my projects interesting 

Alex
