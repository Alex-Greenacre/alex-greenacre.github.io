**Hello Again** 

Any good blog cant start without a good webpage to host it on, to do this I will need a page of my own. 

The main idea of this is to just host a github pages webpage using jekyll as the page generator and sending blog updates on the main branch. This isnt what im usually used to as my past web dev experiences have been in dynamic server side rendering websites (node.js) but the benefits of having a webpage hosted for free that will be up as long as github is and is in the same area as all my other projects is too much to ignore.    

The webpage itself will follow some criteria that i have set this being:
- The website has to consider accessibility, I can't guarantee full accessibility as accessible design takes away some design choices that I want to experiment and implement as well as lacking general resources that I would need to full accessibility test.But that doesn't mean that I shouldn't be striving to make my website as accessible as possible to the people who want to read it     
- Has to showcase my work and what I've been working on 
- Has to contain information about me(cv or about me page)
- Would quite like the site to be usable on both mobile and desktop 
- Should be well documented so I can update it in the future 

## Approach 
To build the website I'm going to be splitting the approach into 3 mvp's
1. Minima - <b>As of writing this is almost done so should be live soon. </b>This is will be a basic site with the blogs being the front page and jekylls minima theme being applied with a few small changes to the header and head, the result of this should be a basic website that will serve as a temporary webpage that I can use whilst continuing to build out the webpage. 
2. Home and Post - The minima theme is a good looking template but modifying themes in jekyll can be tricky especially overwriting the css. The solution to this is to remove the theme and build my own this is by far the biggest undertaking in the project and given my current css skills probably won't look anywhere near as good looking. but the result will be a website which will express my full skillset and one that I can improve upon and add to with every improvement. Aswell as css and theme changes the post will be moved to a different page although I might still keep the most recent on the home page. This will be the biggest bulk of work. To do this I'm most likely going to create a separate branch    
3. About and additional changes - create an about page for my cv and make a few changes to make the page mobile friendly (if not already done) 
After this I'll try to add some additional features and keep updating the site, few ideas that I have are a reports page for data science/analyst reports, a projects page linking to my repos and filter and sort for the blogs page
