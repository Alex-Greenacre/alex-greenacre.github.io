Part two of the websites development is now complete and live 

The idea behind this increment was to switch themes from the minima theme to a new custom style as well as building the home page and blog post page, this goal was completed with custom css and layouts added to the site including a completely new head,header and footer, a new post layout, a blog page to show all posts and a home page to display github projects and recent posts   

## What went well ## 
Website looks good, I think the header works really well in providing colour to the site whilst still keeping it clear, as well as that the site itself is a good foundation for improvments. The speed in which new pages can be added is also really good. Once the templates have been made, adding new posts or pages takes very little effort in terms of development work.  

## What didnt go well ##
When I approached this I didn't really have a clear design. I think this is quite evident in the final design as although it does look clear and functional it definitely doesn't look like the best it could and for a personal portfolio it's a bit bland.

The css also isn't the best which was to be expected, my biggest issue is that currently unique css for pages is stored in the bottom of base, this is fine at the moment but when I go to add more pages it can easily get to complicated allowing for standards to slip and updating the styles to be alot harder. 

Also even though I do like the pros using github pages and a static site brings there is going to be some drawbacks in terms of expandability, as projects that could cover areas such as microservices or an database for storing any potentail data can't be implemented. Although the pros of github pages still outweights these concerns as data storage is unlikely and I can still build the projects for them in github repos and just not implement live.      

## Improvements to be made ##

The home page needs revisiting, at the minute its ok but I think there's too much information on, rather than list all projects I might just list a featured one, this is the same as the posts. This is because the site is supposed to function as a highlight of my skills and currently getting that information is quite hard with the current site showcasing only the latests posts which might not be anywhere near the quaility of a more indepth post that I posted previously. A clearer more to the point home page might cut down on showcasing what I've been up to, but in this case I think less might be more in displaying the most important info first then allowing users to view the rest later.

Another improvement that could be made is around the blogs, currently to view a post you need to click onto the blog then the post, which isn't bad but its an extra two clicks every time you want to read another post, this could be changed by outputting all posts onto the same page and using some sort of pagination to stop the page getting to big. Alternatively another way the blogs could be done is through a project page splitting the blogs and displaying them on a distinct project page that also shows the github info and goal of the project. 


## Conclusion ## 
Overall I'm happy at what I've produced the websites is in a good place for adding content and although I am not thrilled at its current design for a personal portfolio its definitely a good start and it does provide a good foundation for me to make improvements.

Moving forward I need to focus on adding more content and getting the about me page sorted, the small changes on the home page would be a good idea but I think my main focus is to get the about me page finished as mentioned in mvp 3 but the website itself is in a good spot for me to start on other projects and blogging the outcomes and slowly changing the website if needed.
